# AquaAlert: AI-Powered Water Pollution Reporter

Winner – AI for Social Good Showcase (Spring 2025)

# 📍What is AquaAlert?
AquaAlert is a one-click web application that empowers individuals to report illegal dumping and water pollution simply by uploading a photo. It uses AI and computer vision to detect the type of waste, extract the GPS location from image metadata, and auto-notify the appropriate cleanup agencies. The app also shows before-and-after images to inspire environmental action.

# 💡 Why AquaAlert?
Communities often witness waterway pollution but lack the time or tools to report it effectively. AquaAlert removes barriers by automating the reporting process. With just one uploaded image, users contribute to real-world environmental change.
